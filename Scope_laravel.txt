In simple terms laravel scope is just a query, a query to make the code shorter and faster. We can create custom query with relation or anything with scopes. 

Let's create a simple with today() scope and it will get only today records.
Step 1: Create Scope in Model

We will add today scope in our post model. So when we query in controller then we will use that scope in laravel model.
